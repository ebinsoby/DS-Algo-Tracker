# DS Algo Tracker

A repo to track my progress in Data Structures and Algorithms. 

| Questions | Tip| Difficulty |
| --------------- | --------------- | --------------- |
| 1.    Two Number Sum: https://www.algoexpert.io/questions/Two%20Number%20Sum | use Hashmap for O(n) | Easy |
| 2.    Validate Subsequence: https://www.algoexpert.io/questions/Validate%20Subsequence| can be done without a flag, cleaner code | Easy |
| 3.    Sorted Squared Array: https://www.algoexpert.io/questions/Sorted%20Squared%20Array| Two pointers, one for max, one for min. Whenver it is mentioned that the input is in a specific order, that usually hints you that there is a more optimal sol than the brute force one. mostly a linear time complexity is available | Easy |
| 4.    Tournament Winner: https://www.algoexpert.io/questions/Sorted%20Squared%20Array| Object.keys, Object.values | Easy |
| 5.    Non Constructible change: https://www.algoexpert.io/questions/Non-Constructible%20Change| next number to be added (n) > change+1, then new change = change + n, if change = k, then we make change from 1 to K| Easy, tricky |
| 6.    Closest Value in BST: https://www.algoexpert.io/questions/Find%20Closest%20Value%20In%20BST| simple traversal | Easy, tricky |
