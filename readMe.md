# DS Algo Tracker

A repo to track my progress in Data Structures and Algorithms. 

| Questions | Tip| Difficulty |
| --------------- | --------------- | --------------- |
| Two Number Sum: https://www.algoexpert.io/questions/Two%20Number%20Sum | use Hashmap for O(n) | Easy |
| Validate Subsequence: https://www.algoexpert.io/questions/Validate%20Subsequence| can be done without a flag, cleaner code | Easy |
| Sorted Squared Array: https://www.algoexpert.io/questions/Sorted%20Squared%20Array| Two pointers, one for max, one for min. Whenver it is mentioned that the input is in a specific order, that usually hints you that there is a more optimal sol than the brute force one. mostly a linear time complexity is available | Easy |
| Tournament Winner: https://www.algoexpert.io/questions/Sorted%20Squared%20Array| good to know Object.keys, Object.values | Easy |
