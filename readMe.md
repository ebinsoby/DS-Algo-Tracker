# DS Algo Tracker

A repo to track my progress in Data Structures and Algorithms. 

| Questions | Tip| Difficulty |
| --------------- | --------------- | --------------- |
| 1.    Two Number Sum: https://www.algoexpert.io/questions/Two%20Number%20Sum | use Hashmap for O(n) | Easy |
| 2.    Validate Subsequence: https://www.algoexpert.io/questions/Validate%20Subsequence| can be done without a flag, cleaner code | Easy |
| 3.    Sorted Squared Array: https://www.algoexpert.io/questions/Sorted%20Squared%20Array| Two pointers, one for max, one for min. Whenver it is mentioned that the input is in a specific order, that usually hints you that there is a more optimal sol than the brute force one. mostly a linear time complexity is available | Easy |
| 4.    Tournament Winner: https://www.algoexpert.io/questions/Sorted%20Squared%20Array| Object.keys, Object.values | Easy |
| 5.    Non Constructible change: https://www.algoexpert.io/questions/Non-Constructible%20Change| next number to be added (n) > change+1, then new change = change + n, if change = k, then we make change from 1 to K| Easy, tricky |
| 6.    Closest Value in BST: https://www.algoexpert.io/questions/Find%20Closest%20Value%20In%20BST| simple traversal, avg time(Balanced BST) - O(logN), worst case - O(N)(One branch tree, so we are not eliminating half the BST in each step). If done recursively space- O(N), iteratively - O(1)| Easy |
| 7.    Branch Sums: https://www.algoexpert.io/questions/Branch%20Sums| simple traversal | Easy |
| 8.    Node Depths : https://www.algoexpert.io/questions/Node%20Depths| recursive is intuitive, take a look at iterative approach using stack | Easy |
| 9.    Depth first search : https://www.algoexpert.io/questions/Depth-first%20Search | Understand that time complexity is O(V+E), because- sum(pushing the vertex to array)= V, sum(traversing the neibhour of each node) = E | Easy |
| 10.   Minimum waiting Time : https://www.algoexpert.io/questions/Minimum%20Waiting%20Time | Understand that time complexity is O(V+E), because- sum(pushing the vertex to array)= V, sum(traversing the neibhour of each node) = E | Easy |
| 11.   Class Photos : https://www.algoexpert.io/questions/Class%20Photos |  | Easy |
| 12.   Tandem Cycle : https://www.algoexpert.io/questions/Tandem%20Bicycle |  | Easy |
| 13.   Remove Duplicates from Linked List : https://www.algoexpert.io/questions/Remove%20Duplicates%20From%20Linked%20List |  | Easy |
| 14.   Nth Fibonacci : https://www.algoexpert.io/questions/Remove%20Duplicates%20From%20Linked%20List | in the memoization solution, if i put: If(memo(n)) instead of if(n in memo)  | Easy |
